The year is 5224, the planet is call meowearth24; which is in war since 2024 where the cats and dogs become consious and rebel angainst the man creating a big laserbean and shooting very big and very far away from milkway. When you shoot in the dark you discovered a race of alien dogs called labraailliens14, now dogs and cats are in war.

Cats discocerd Hy language and inject ships on they brains, which enhance they skills like dropping mug cups, improved long sleeping from 20 to 24 hours and the most antecipated skill tree climbing. There is a big treat to meowearth24, cats are working a much bigger laser bean in order to defend they planet.

Your job is write a Hy program that can perfect center the laserbean. In oder to so, we need to caliber the center modulo by passing a parameter, this parameter can only be achive by coding in Hy. To get the laser parameter, we need to run a binary seach on the coordinates of the 3 last execution runs from the previous laser from 2024. Here are the 3 last execution logs from the laser bean:

```
02.FEB.5224 12:34:34.313 = [3 6 7 10 14 19 21 25 36]
07.FEB.5224 15:04:14.214 = [4 7 8 11 15 20 22 26 37]
27.FEB.5224 19:41:52.320 = [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 12 16 22]
```

You need to look for the center most of the planet which is 7. Get the binary seach of the last 3 execution logs, sum them up and add one, and there you get the parameter for calibration of the new laser bean.
